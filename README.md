# simple-pre-commit
**GitHub action to run pre-commit on your python repository (using existing .pre-commit-config.yaml file)**

Forked from [jpetrucciani's 'black check'](https://github.com/jpetrucciani/black-check)
*(now updated to use pre-commit as a formatting manager)*

## Example usage

```yaml
uses: samwlms/simple-pre-commit@master
